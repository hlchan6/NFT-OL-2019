	abstract = {Nonlocal reverse space–time equations of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) type were recently introduced. They were shown to be integrable infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, and the inverse scattering transform (IST) for rapidly decaying initial conditions was constructed. Here, we present the IST for the reverse space–time NLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions (NZBCs) at infinity. The NZBC problem is more complicated because the branching structure of the associated linear eigenfunctions is complicated. We analyze two cases, which correspond to two different values of the phase at infinity. We discuss special soliton solutions and find explicit one-soliton and two-soliton solutions. We also consider spatially dependent boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {There is a fundamental limit on the capacity of fibre optical communication system (Shannon Limit). This limit can be potentially overcome via using Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexing. Dealing with noises in these systems is one of the most critical parts in implementing a practical system. In this paper, we discover and characterize the correlations among the NFT channels. It is demonstrated that the correlation is universal (i.e., independent of types of system noises) and can be exploited to maximize transmission throughput. We propose and experimentally confirm a noise model showing that end-to-end noise can be modelled as the accumulation of noise associated with each segment of optical communication which can be dealt with independently. Also, each point noise can be further decomposed into different components, some of which are more significant (and even dominating) than others. Hence, one can further approximate and simplify the noise model by focusing on the significant component.},

	abstract = {We describe a method to estimate the capacity limit of fiber-optic communication systems (or “fiber channels”) based on information theory. This paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 reviews fundamental concepts of digital communications and information theory. We treat digitization and modulation followed by information theory for channels both without and with memory. We provide explicit relationships between the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio and the optical signal-to-noise ratio. We further evaluate the performance of modulation constellations such as quadrature-amplitude modulation, combinations of amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying, exotic constellations, and concentric rings for an additive white Gaussian noise channel using coherent detection. Part 2 is devoted specifically to the ``fiber channel.'' We review the physical phenomena present in transmission over optical fiber networks, including sources of noise, the need for optical filtering in optically-routed networks, and, most critically, the presence of fiber Kerr nonlinearity. We describe various transmission scenarios and impairment mitigation techniques, and define a fiber channel deemed to be the most relevant for communication over optically-routed networks. We proceed to evaluate a capacity limit estimate for this fiber channel using ring constellations. Several scenarios are considered, including uniform and optimized ring constellations, different fiber dispersion maps, and varying transmission distances. We further present evidences that point to the physical origin of the fiber capacity limitations and provide a comparison of recent record experiments with our capacity limit estimation.},

The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in such models, in much the same way that the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In this three-part series of papers, this observation is exploited for data transmission over integrable channels, such as optical fibers, where pulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear frequencies and their spectral amplitudes. Unlike most other fiber-optic transmission schemes, this technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation methods. This paper explains the mathematical tools that underlie the method.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the looming capacity crunch in fiber-optic networks, information transmission over such systems is revisited. Among numerous distortions, interchannel interference in multiuser wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is identified as the seemingly intractable factor limiting the achievable rate at high launch power. However, this distortion and similar ones arising from nonlinearity are primarily due to the use of methods suited for linear systems, namely WDM and linear pulse-train transmission, for the nonlinear optical channel. Exploiting the integrability of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, a nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) scheme is presented, which directly modulates noninteracting signal degrees-of-freedom under NLS propagation. The main distinction between this and previous methods is that NFDM is able to cope with the nonlinearity, and thus, as the signal power or transmission distance is increased, the new method does not suffer from the deterministic crosstalk between signal components, which has degraded the performance of previous approaches. In this paper, emphasis is placed on modulation of the discrete component of the nonlinear Fourier transform of the signal and some simple examples of achievable spectral efficiencies are provided.},

For linear channels, this was established in classic works of Nyquist and Shannon. However, despite the immense practical importance of fibre–optic communications providing for {\textgreater}99\% of global data traffic, the channel capacity of optical links remains unknown due to the complexity introduced by fibre nonlinearity. Recently, there has been a flurry of studies examining an expected cap that nonlinearity puts on the information-carrying capacity of fibre–optic systems. Mastering the nonlinear channels requires paradigm shift from current modulation, coding and transmission techniques originally developed for linear communication systems. Here we demonstrate that using the integrability of the master model and the nonlinear Fourier transform, the lower bound on the capacity per symbol can be estimated as 10.7 bits per symbol with 500 GHz bandwidth over 2,000 km.},

	abstract = {Long-haul optical communications based on nonlinear Fourier Transform have gained attention recently as a new communication strategy that inherently embrace the nonlinear nature of the optical fiber. For communications using discrete eigenvalues λ ∈ C+, information are encoded and decoded in the spectral amplitudes q(λ) = b(λ)/(da(λ)/dλ) at the root λrt where a(λrt) = 0. In this paper, we propose two alternative decoding methods using a(λ) and b(λ) instead of q(λ) as decision metrics. For discrete eigenvalue modulation systems, we show that symbol decisions usinga(λ) at a prescribed set of λ values perform similarly to conventional methods using q(λ) but avoid root searching, and, thus, significantly reduce computational complexity. For systems with phase and amplitude modulation on a given discrete eigenvalue, we propose to use b(λ) after for symbol detection and show that the noise in da(λ)/dλ and λrt after transmission is all correlated with that in b(λrt). A linear minimum mean square error estimator of the noise in b(λrt) is derived based on such noise correlation and transmission performance is considerably improved for QPSK and 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation systems on discrete eigenvalues.},

Recently, however, a growing realization has emerged within the telecommunications industry that the end of the phenomenal growth in optical fiber communication capacity is within sight. At this year's Optical Fiber Communication Conference (OFC 2010), several groups reported results within a factor of ∼2 of the ultimate capacity limits of existing optical fiber technology. Without radical innovation in our physical network infrastructure—that is, improvements in the key physical properties of transmission fibers and the optical amplifiers that we rely on to transmit data over long distances—we face what has been widely referred to as a “capacity crunch” that could severely constrain future Internet growth, as well as having social and political ramifications.

	abstract = {Multi-soliton pulses are potential candidates for fiber optical transmission where the information is modulated and recovered in the so-called nonlinear Fourier domain. While this is an elegant technique to account for the channel nonlinearity, the obtained spectral efficiency, so far, is not competitive with the classic Nyquist-based schemes. In this paper, we study the evolution of the time-bandwidth product of multi-solitons as they propagate along the optical fiber. For second and third order soliton pulses, we numerically optimize the pulse shapes to achieve the smallest time-bandwidth product when the phase of the spectral amplitudes is used for modulation. Moreover, we analytically estimate the pulse-duration and bandwidth of multi-solitons in some practically important cases. Those estimations enable us to approximate the time-bandwidth product for higher order solitons.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIT.2015.2485944},
	abstract = {The nonlinear Fourier transform, which is also known as the forward scattering transform, decomposes a periodic signal into nonlinearly interacting waves. In contrast to the common Fourier transform, these waves no longer have to be sinusoidal. Physically relevant waveforms are often available for the analysis instead. The details of the transform depend on the waveforms underlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit assumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For example, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be expressed in terms of cnoidal waves. Light waves in optical fiber governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NSE) are another example. Nonlinear analogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in many applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed by Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one. The nonlinear Fourier transform is eminently suited to address them - at least from a theoretical point of view. Although numerical algorithms are available for computing the transform, a fast nonlinear Fourier transform that is similarly effective as the fast Fourier transform is for computing the common Fourier transform has not been available so far. The goal of this paper is to address this problem. Two fast numerical methods for computing the nonlinear Fourier transform with respect to the NSE are presented. The first method achieves a runtime of O(D2) floating point operations, where D is the number of sample points. The second method applies only to the case where the NSE is defocusing, but it achieves an O(D log2D) runtime. Extensions of the results to other evolution equations are discussed as well.},

	abstract = {The achievable data rates of current fiber-optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) systems are limited by nonlinear interactions between different subchannels. Recently, it was thus proposed to replace the conventional Fourier transform in WDM systems with an appropriately defined nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT). The computational complexity of NFTs is a topic of current research. In this paper, a fast inverse NFT algorithm for the important special case of multi-solitonic signals is presented. The algorithm requires only O(Dlog2D) floating point operations to compute D samples of a multi-soliton. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for this problem with log2-linear complexity. The paper also includes a many-samples analysis of the generated nonlinear Fourier spectra.},
